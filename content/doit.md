# What is "Do It"?

**"Do It"** is a happy coincidence. It sounds like how my last name, *De Wit*, is often pronounced in English. But beyond that, these two words capture the essence of a philosophy I've put together over time. It's a way of thinking I try to follow in how I live, work, and create.  This essay explains why, by unpacking the three core meanings of Do It.

## **1. *Do it* — Choosing to Act (Agency through Existentialism)**

The first association that probably comes to mind when you hear *Do It* is something like the Nike slogan. A call to action that urges you to stop hesitating, stop making excuses, and just get going. Don't overthink. Don't blame your circumstances. Don't wallow in self-pity. Just do the thing.

That spirit absolutely lives within what I mean by *Do It,* but with an important caveat.

It should never be about acting *in spite* of your desires. It's not about forcing yourself through pain or doing something for the wrong reasons. *Do It* is not a demand for discipline at all costs. It's about *choosing* to act. Not because someone else told you to. Not out of guilt, pressure, or obligation. But because *you* want to. Because you have a desire and you have the power to move.

This is a fundamental truth: agency is built into all of us. We have the capacity to make choices. To act intentionally. And I believe deeply that we should regularly remind ourselves of this fact—and use it to guide how we live.

This idea echoes existentialist philosophy, which emphasizes that humans are radically free, and we can use that freedom to escape the inherent meaningless of the world. If this resonates, I highly recommend two works that powerfully articulate it: Jean-Paul Sartre's *Existentialism Is a Humanism*, and one of my favorite books—Viktor Frankl's *Man's Search for Meaning*

## **2. Do *it* — Solve Problems That Matter (Direction through Critical Rationalism)**

Agency is powerful — but where should we direct it? Where can we have meaningful impact? 

Stephen Hawking once described humanity as "chemical scum on a moderate-sized planet," emphasizing our insignificance in the universe. But he was wrong.

Humans are the most significant force in the cosmos — because we *can solve* problems. The coldest temperature ever achieved wasn't out in deep space. It was created here, on Earth, in a lab at MIT. We've synthesized entirely new elements that don't exist naturally in the universe by smashing atoms together in particle accelerators. We've turned rocks and fire into spacecraft that have left the solar system. Voyager 1, a human-made object, is now more than 15 billion miles away, still whispering data back to us.

As David Deutsch points out, the extraordinary progress of the past few hundred years began with the Enlightenment—when the West developed something unprecedented: a *culture of criticism*. This meant rejecting authority and embracing open debate, where ideas could be freely shared, criticized, and improved. The potential for progress was always there, but static social norms held it back. The Enlightenment unleashed human creativity and it hasn't stopped since.

We've seen open-ended progress in health, living standards, knowledge, and more. There's no reason it should end. In fact, the culture of criticism is so powerful that we may be at the *beginning of infinity*—an era of limitless problem-solving and advancement.

So what does this mean for our question of *What to do*?  It means we're freeer than ever to pursue any problems we care about. That might be raising a family, building a business, writing a novel, exploring a field, or discovering a new frontier. Any creative effort toward a goal you find meaningful *is* progress. We are built to solve problems and since the Enlightenment, the brakes are off. Every solved problem becomes a stepping stone on humanity's infinite journey ahead.

In this context, the phrase "Do It" emphasizes the "*It"—* namely*,* the problem *you* choose to work on. 

## **3. *Do* it — Act Without Attachment (Awareness through Non-dualism)**

The final piece of the puzzle is *how* to approach the problems that matter to us.

Yes, we're born with the mental capacities for creativity and agency. But that doesn't mean our mental state is naturally lucid and uncluttered. In fact, the opposite is usually true. Most of us operate under conditioned patterns we didn't consciously choose. From a young age, we're nudged to associate our thoughts, emotions, and roles with who we are: *"You're so clever."* *"Don't be angry."* *"Good job!"* Slowly, we internalize the idea that we *are* our minds.

We identify with the mind's contents—its thoughts, feelings, and stories—and start calling that "me." Once that happens, we become attached to a self-image. We want to be seen—and to see ourselves—as kind, successful, intelligent, attractive. These aren't just preferences, they become conditions for our peace and self-worth. We fear anything that contradicts the image we've built. Even in private, we judge ourselves by whether we measure up to this internal ideal.

Suffering begins here. Not because life is inherently painful, but because we're constantly managing how we're seen, suppressing how we feel, and defending this mental fiction of "me." We don't fear failure, we fear what failure *says* about us—to others, and especially to ourselves. We don't fear discomfort, we fear what it might reveal. We've traded living for living up to an ideal.

Anthony De Mello put it plainly: suffering arises when we are "asleep," when we mistake the mind's narratives for truth. But the self-image is a mirage. The mind is just a tool. *You are not your mind. You are the awareness that sees the mind.*

When this becomes clear, life stops being about protecting or upgrading an identity. You act based on genuine preference, not to validate who you think you are. There's no self-image to fulfill, no identity to maintain. Peace and clarity are already here when we stop clinging to the stories.

The meaning of *Do It* in this case stresses the "Do." The focus is on the doing itself, not on proving, protecting, or improving a self-image. The most effective and joyful way to act is to do what you prefer, simply and directly, from awareness. No identity to fix. No self to become. Just, *Do* It for its own sake.

## Putting the 3 meanings together

The three meanings of *Do It* answer three core questions:

1. **Where to start?** *Do it* — Choose to act. Apply your agency.
2. **What to do?** Do *it* — Work on problems that matter to *you*.
3. **How to do it?** *Do* it — Take action from awareness, not attachment.

Together, they form a complete and practical life philosophy.

## What happens when the trifecta is incomplete?

The three meanings of *Do It*—agency, direction, and awareness—are not just complementary; they're interdependent. When one is missing, something essential breaks down. Here's what tends to happen in each case:

### **1. Agency + Direction, but no Awareness**

*"Driven, yet performative"*

You act decisively and aim at intentional goals, but without awareness, your actions are entangled with ego. You become obsessed with outcomes, recognition, or self-improvement. There's stress, over-identification, and burnout. You're chasing success, but it never feels like enough.

### **2. Agency + Awareness, but no Direction**

*"Productive, yet ineffective"*

You're acting freely and with presence, but your efforts are scattered. Without a focus on solving meaningful problems, you're chronically busy—but not impactful. You experiment a lot, multitask, start many projects out of genuine interest, but it feels hollow because you rarely complete anything and lack an overall clear clear direction.  

### **3. Direction + Awareness, but no Agency**

*"Wise, yet inconsequential"*

You see clearly and understand what matters, but you're not acting on it. You might be reflective, insightful, or even spiritually grounded—but stuck in theory. Ideas stay in your head. Projects never leave the notebook. Wisdom, unexpressed, has no real-world impact.

### **Only one element? You stagnate.**

- **Only Agency?** You're impulsive.
- **Only Direction?** You overthink and hesitate.
- **Only Awareness?** You drift, detached from action or change.

True effectiveness—both in how you live and what you contribute—comes from holding all three together. *Agency* gets you moving. *Direction* ensures it matters. *Awareness* makes it sustainable and ego-free.

That's the power of *Do It* in full.
