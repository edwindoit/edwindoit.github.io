## Background & experience

I’ve fulfilled the role of COO in a 30+ employee health tech organization Formelio. Brought the company from from start-up to scale-up to stay-up. Along the way, I established our operational domains and took on the following roles:

- Product Designer
- Service Manager (& Customer Support)
- Project Manager
- Product Owner (& Sprint Facilitator)
- Solution Architect
- Product Manager
- COO

My experience is beyond tooling, organization, and management. It comes from hands-on work and a fundamental understanding of what is supposed to go on in each business domain.
