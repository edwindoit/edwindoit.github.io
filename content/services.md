If you're tired of stringing together bloated systems for documentation, project management, road mapping, feedback management, task management, and on and on... 

Then you're not alone. 

After setting up and running our 40+ employee tech company in notion for the past 3 years I've learned how it can be done better with Notion.

## My background

I’ve fulfilled the role of COO in a 40+ employee health tech organization Formelio. We brought the company from from start-up to scale-up to stay-up. During this time I’ve instantiated and performed many roles:

- Product Designer
- Service Manager (& Customer Support)
- Project Manager
- Product Owner (Sprint Facilitator)
- Solution Architect
- Product Manager

My experience is beyond tooling, organization, and management. It comes from hands-on work and a fundamental understanding of what is supposed to go on in each business domain.
