> ### I explore how fundamental explanations of reality can help us optimize our actions

**Currently, I am...** 

- Creating a weekly [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/@edwindoit) on: How to Practically Apply the Ideas of David Deutsch

### The Do It Newsletter 

Every month, I share an actionable rundown of what I'm working on and the great resources I come across. It covers effectiveness, health, productivity, technology, and reasoning.

## About
Iâ€™m interested in understanding how the world works and using that knowledge to become more effective. Right now, Iâ€™m most passionate about writing The 4 Acts, a problem-solving framework I created based on Critical Rationalism and the ideas of David Deutsch. The 4 Acts is not about solving just any problem or maximizing output. Itâ€™s about making progress toward a specific and intentional outcome. That takes more than productivity; it requires reflecting on your direction and questioning what truly matters.
